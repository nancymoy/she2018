# Notes about the fullPage.js SHEPOW website

### What is fullPage.js? A simple and easy to use libary to create fullscreen scrolling websites (also known as single page websites or onepage sites). It allows the creation of fullscreen scrolling websites, as well as adding some landscape sliders inside the sections of the site.

**GITHUB page for fullPage.js: [DOCS](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js)**

- The base file is website.html, the base style sheet is style.css
- fullPage.js requires its own .css and .js file, they are included in this repo folder 
- fullPage.js also requires jquery, jquery ui - they are being served via a CDN in the header of the html file
- Optional jquery plugin CDNs are also included in the header, in case we need them for some of the effects
- Currently there is some basic style written, but this is only place holding
- Pay attention to section and slide tags, they do what you would expect
